# 1. Introduction

Development of the Online Virtual Phone System relies heavily on the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. It contains an introduction, a detailed project overview, specific requirements, and supporting data. A thorough project description containing the product concepts, functions, user profiles, and dependencies is given after the introduction, which establishes the context. The explicit requirements are described in the document's core, including interfaces, functionality, performance standards, and design limitations. It also offers appendices that assist the software and its qualities. Throughout the whole lifecycle of the software project, the SRS acts as a dynamic reference, allowing consistency and transparent communication.

## 1.1 Purpose

The primary purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed overview of the Online Virtual Phone System. It will explain the purpose and features of the system, as well as the interfaces of the system, constraints, and assumptions. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system.

Through this document, the intent is to create an understanding of the system for the stakeholders and developers. The stakeholders will be able to understand the system's purpose and features, while the developers will be able to understand the system's requirements and constraints ultimately leading to delivering a phone system that meets the stakeholders' requirements.

# 2. General Description

## 2.1 User Characteristics

The users for the product will fall into one of two categories: administrator or user. 

The users will be adults, located at various locations across the globe with various levels of internet strength and reliability. Given the geographic diversity of the users, not everyone will speak the same language. The users will be using the product for both professional and personal use. As such the user may be an individual or a business, requiring extensions to reach multiple departments within the business. Users are expected to have varying levels of technical literacy. 

Administrators will be IT professionals with extensive knowledge and training and strong techinical literacy. These users will be located in Canada with a strong, reliable internet connection. 

## 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

It is assumed all users of the system will have the ability to connect to the internet with adequate speeds to allow for full functionality of the application. 

All users should have the necessary hardware and operating systems to support the app. We will accommodate operating systems from 2015-present day. Any operating systems that date back past 2015 will be incompatible. Hardware components such as a mobile device, desktop, speakers and microphones are assumed to be provided by the user.

Each user will have the ability to make a payment digitally via credit card or PayPal using CAD as the currency of choice. Should the user prefer an alternative currency it is assumed that the third party chosen to manage and route the transactions will be responsible for the conversion and any inform the user of any fees imposed by the users bank. 

While not all users will be fluent in English, it is assumed the users will be familar enough with one of the 4 languages provided to navigate the app without too much difficulty. 

The app will depend on the use of third party services to manage payment. As such, agreements must be made between the Online Virtual Phone System and the chosen third party.
