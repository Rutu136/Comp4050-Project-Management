# Introduction

## Purpose of Project Charter

The Online Virtual Phone System project charter documents and tracks the
necessary information required by decision maker(s) to approve the
project for funding. The project charter should include the needs,
scope, justification, and resource commitment as well as the project's
sponsor(s) decision to proceed or not to proceed with the project. It is
created during the Initiating Phase of the project.

The intended audience of the Online Virtual Phone System project charter is the project sponsor and senior leadership.

# Project And Product Overview

The Online Virtual Phone System is a cloud-based solution that enables users to make calls over the internet without the need for a traditional physical phone line which will compete with Skype. The system will allow users make and recieve call on both their desktop app, mobile app and all from a single business phone number.   

The estimated project duration will be 1 year but Minimum Viable Product will be delivered within 3 months.

The estimated project budget is $500K for the whole project, but only $120K can be spent during first 3 months of the project.

# Justification

# Assumptions, Constraints And Risks

## Assumptions

\[Example: The system is being developed to capture data from public
health partners. One assumption is that data is entered electronically
into the system.\]

This section identifies the statements believed to be true and from
which a conclusion was drawn to define this project charter.

1.  **Client Access:** The client will have provide necessary access to the required 
    for the virtual call system.
2.  **Administrator Access:** Multiple administrators will be able to access the system 
    to manage the system. However, only one administrator will be able to access the system at a time.
3.  **User Privilages:** User privilages are limited to "originate calls" and "receive calls".
4.  **IP Network Reliability:** The IP network will be reliable and sockets are default form of communication.
5.  **Database Reliability:** The database will be reliable and prevent data loss and inconsistencies.
6.  **Billing:** The system will be able to bill the users based on the usage of the system with precision.
   

## Constraints

This section identifies any limitation that must be taken into
consideration prior to the initiation of the project.

1.  **Time Constraints:** The project is constrained to be completed with a time frame of 13 weeks for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and further 1 year for a full system, Any changes to the timeline will be discussed with the client.
2.  **Resource Constraints:** The project is constrained to be completed with a budget of $120K for MVP and $500K for the whole project. Any changes to the budget will be discussed with the client.
3.  **Regulatory and Compliance Constraint:** The system must comply with all the regulatory requirements of the country of deployment.
4.  **IP Network Availability Constraint:** The system relies on the availability of the IP network for communication.
5.  **Scalability Constraint:** The system must be designed to be scalable for future growth.

## Risks

| Risks                             | Mitigation                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Security and Access | Implement robust security measures as encryption and authentication |
| Data Loss | Use checksums and data validation techniques to detect and prevent data corruption. |
| Call Quality and Latency | Use a reliable and fast IP network to ensure call quality and low latency. |
| Network Overload | Use a scalable system to handle the load and prevent network overload. |
| Billing Errors | Implement accurate mathematical algorithms to calculate the bill and provide bill auditing. |
