<center><H1>Introduction</H1></center>

This document offers a comprehensive overview of the potential risks associated with the automated railway reservation system (ARRS). All identified risks have been assigned a probability of occurring along with the financial impact they would have if they came to fruition. Of the risks identified, a select few were reasoned to have the most severe repercussions and thus a response strategy for each has been developed. 


<center><H1>Risk Identification and Ranking</H1></center>

## Risk Categories and Identification

### Mission and goals 
- The requirement that the system accommodate other railroads is irrelevant to the CRM.
- The scope creep, additional deliverables are being added to the prototype without extending the deadlines.

### Organization management
- Limited to the resources provided by the CRM, unable to bring in any additional team members that the PM may need. 
The language barrier within the team, since some of the team members cannot speak or write English.

### Customer
- The potential for insufficient customer engagement processes, leading to a lack of critical feedback that may not align with user expectations.

### Budget/cost
- The project budget is vulnerable to exchange rate volatility, which could inflate the cost of resources gotten from abroad.

### Schedule
- The PM appears to have little say in the deadlines that are being imposed by the CRM. 
- Imposed dates and their belief that the project is easily doable with CASE tools may lead to improper testing and quality assurance.
- The timeline of developing, testing, and integrating a prototype within 90 days poses a risk as it may not provide sufficient time for development. Rushed development increases the likelihood of overlooking critical issues, resulting in a prototype with unresolved bugs and reduced performance.
- Lack of complete research before starting the development creates critical situations for developers to go back and forth everytime a new research conflict with the previous phase.

### Project content
- The implementation of a complex database to run complex queries, may require additional resources, allocate more budget and extra time.

### Performance 
- The difference in the expected number of reservations during testing and actual deployment. Higher numbers could cause the system to fail in terms of speed and responsiveness.

### Project management 
- The limited experience in project management and their need for domain expertise.

### Development process 
- The reliance on CRM-provided state-of-the-art hardware and software introduces a risk because the historical track record of unsuccessful projects within CRM suggests potential challenges. Even though the components are considered advanced, past failures may indicate issues in implementation, integration, or compatibility that could impact the reliability of the ARRS.
- The risk associated with scalability arises from the need to transition from a successful prototype to a full-scale system. Inadequate experience among developers in designing hardware infrastructure for scalability increases the likelihood of encountering challenges when expanding the system.

### Development environment
- While the CRM will provide the physical resources, the PM is prohibited from bringing anything additional into the country that they may need along the way 

### Staff
- Most developers that are being provided lack prior experience with software engineering concepts esp object oriented programming which will be used to create the system 
- The communication barrier within the team, particularly if CRM personnel do not fully understand the software components due to language issues, poses a risk. Incomplete or inaccurate documentation may lead to operational errors and system instability, as the team may struggle to interpret and implement the intended functionalities correctly.

### Maintenance 
- Local developers do not know about object-oriented programming and telecommunications which could impact on the stability and maintenance of software
- The absence of a clearly defined transition plan for maintenance responsibilities, from development to operation, could lead to system downtime, and increased long-term 

### **Security Threat**
- Because of lack of experience of developers in an agile environment. Factor of not following each phases promptly can lead to successful breaches.  Not only can data breaches cause financial losses, but they can also harm the ARRS's reputation and weaken user confidence.

### **Regulatory Compliance**
- The risk arises from the diverse geographical origins of the development team, leading to potential variations in legal regulations. Differences in legal frameworks and compliance standards may affect the team's understanding of regulatory requirements.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
There is a risk of significant scope creep and a lack of focus on the clients needs given that there is a desire to have the system accommodate other railroads. This is irrelevant to the CRM, may lead to the client being unsatisfied with the final product or delays to fulfill requirements outside of what CRM is expecting. | Project Manager | Mitigate |Assess how a focus on multi-system compatibility will impact that project and communicate this to the stakeholders to make them aware of how this will impact the budget, timeline, and scope.|Time to prepare and meet with key stakeholders.|Start mitigation process as soon and possible and finish before starting project initiation.|Should the decision to prioritize compatibility prevail, have all design decisions facilitate this request right from the start to help ensure success and minimize technical debt.  
There is a risk of communication due to a language barrier and reliance on interpreters. This can create layers of complexity and potential misinterpretation such as interpreters may not be able to capture the nuances of the technical discussion. Language barriers could lead to a decision making process which may cause trouble reaching the project deadline and goals.|DevelopmentTeam and Project Manager|Mitigating|Project managers should set up Regular meetings with Stakeholders, development teams, and end-users. Team should use collaborative communication tools, develop a communication plan to make clear goals and avoid misunderstanding.|Allocate $5000 to get a subscription of needed communication tools.|Start as soon as project initiation starts.|Should develop communication channels and schedules for developers to make efficient information exchange. In case primary communication tools become unavailable, have alternative tools ready and ensure that team members know how to use them.
The risk is that the insufficient testing on the prototype, resulting from time constraints, could have a serious impact on the final developed system including unresolved bugs, a less reliable system and failure on loading response.|Development Team and Project Manager|Avoiding |Set up priority:The team should prioritize the critical testing scenarios Use of technology:The team should establish automated testing pipelines to save time.Communication:The team should actively participate in the review process to avoid injection of unknown bugs, and consider continuous development.|Allocate an extra budget of around $20,000 for hiring professional testers and they may require additional testing tools. |Start as soon as functional features are deployed.|Considering to release the prototype with an explicit note of potential risks it might have and a commitment to fixing those issues after release update.
Variations in legal regulations due to developers from different countries can affect the project’s progress.|Legal and Compliance Team|Mitigating|Conduct comprehensive legal compliance training for all team members, focusing on both international and local regulations relevant to the project. Regularly update the team on legal changes.|Allocate $10,000 for legal consultation and training materials.|Begin training in the early stages of the project and give regular updates throughout the project lifecycle.|In the case of significant legal changes, reassess and adjust project plans according to how significant the situation will be. Also, consider hiring legal experts for ongoing support if necessary.
Most developers lack experience in software engineering concepts, especially object-oriented programming, leading to technical debt, bugs, delays, and difficulty in implementing new features.|Development Team|Mitigating|Provide intensive training in software engineering concepts and object-oriented programming.
